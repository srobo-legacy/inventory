    PSP LCD display from SR2011 power board assembly
    Poor display quality -- changes in the picture tend to fade, as if they've
    been burnt in, and grey scanlines appear on the image, making it seem as if
    it's a lower resolution that it is.
    Could still be shipped if there's kit pressure, so don't throw it away.
