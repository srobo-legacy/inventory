    PSP LCD display from SR2011 power board assembly
    Shows vertical red, green and blue lines on the left edge.
    When powered, the backlight slowly fades. Additionally the picture shown
    is offset vertically by about +70 pixels for no apparently reason. Tested
    on more than one power board, it's definitely the LCD failing.
