    Revision D BeagleBoard.
    When flashing the 2012 firmware onto this (to test whether it works), linux
    fails to detect/mount the SD card. (Despite uboot having loaded the kernel
    from it).

    Perhaps that's fixable, but for the moment it's a good indicator that this 
    board is broken in some way.
